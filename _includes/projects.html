    <ul>
      <li> Python (scimage, pandas), Jupyter, Git</li>

    <p>Working through the image set from MIT, this is a basic image classification to identify foreground figures from background. In particular, this was set up to help people catch up for the Image Classification introduction held by the Portland Data Science Group.</p>

    <p>Kevin Emery has been, and still is one of my biggest supporters.  He started a business with my mom when, and I made their brochures when I was seven.  When I saw his website, I wanted to help get him back on track.  I helped him redesign his website flow, UI, marketing materials, and sign-up pages. </p>
